-- Renormalize the fractions of items in GRP_ID, preserving the
-- existing order. The new fractions are not strictly optimal, but
-- doing better would require much more complex calculations.
--
-- the purpose of the complex update is as follows: we want to assign
-- a new series of values 1/2, 3/2, 5/2, ... to the existing rows,
-- maintaining the existing order, but because the unique expression
-- index is not deferrable, we want to avoid assigning any new value
-- that collides with an existing one.
--
-- We do this by calculating, for each existing row with an x/2 value,
-- which position in the new sequence it would appear at. This is done
-- by adjusting the value of p downwards according to the number of
-- earlier values in sequence. To see why, consider:
--
--   existing values:    3, 9,13,15,23
--   new simple values:  1, 3, 5, 7, 9,11,13,15,17,19,21
--                          *     *  *        *
--   adjusted values:    1, 5, 7,11,17,19,21,25,27,29,31
--
--   points of adjustment: 3, 7 (9-2), 9 (13-4, 15-6), 15 (23-8)
--
-- The * mark the places where an adjustment has to be applied.
--
-- Having calculated the adjustment points, the adjusted value is
-- simply the simple value adjusted upwards according to the number of
-- points passed (counting multiplicity).
